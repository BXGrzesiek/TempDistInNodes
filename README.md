Student project written in Java.

The program calculates the temperature distribution 
in a one-dimensional structure with given boundary conditions 
and specific parameters of elements.

Data entered and read from a text file.
The result is the values of individual cells 
of the local matrix depending on the number 
of elements on which the structure is divided.

Local arrays aggregated into one global matrix.
On the basis of operations performed on the surface, 
we get the temperature values in individual nodes.
